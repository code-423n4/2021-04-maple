## :handshake: Sponsors: Step By Step
Each contest uses two repos: a public one (this one) and a _private_ one where issues are submitted using the contest form. The private contest repo will be made public after the contest has been judged and identified issues are mitigated by the sponsor team.

Here's your part in getting the contest ready to go and joining the private repo.

- [x] Fork the public repo for your contest. (This one.)
- [x] Modify this `README.md` file to describe how your code is supposed to work with links to any relevent documentation and any other criteria/details that the C4 Wardens should keep in mind when reviewing.
- [x] Add all of the code to this repo that you want reviewed.
- [x] Make sure your code is thoroughly commented using the [NatSpec format](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.10/natspec-format.html#natspec-format).
- [x] Create a PR with the above changes.
- [ ] In your repo, list the GitHub handles to be added to the private contest repo.

The codebase to audit will be https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core, which includes the MPL token as a submodule (repo located [here](https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-token)).

All technical documentation for the protocol is located in the maple-core [wiki](https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core/wiki).

The commit hashes to be used for this contest are 
- `maple-core`: `blank`
- `maple-token`: `cb8aab71590550ca6058250f705a0ab52e209585`

Please have contracts and documentation added to this repo **no less than 8 hours prior to contest start time.**
