The codebase to audit will be the `maple-core` repository (located [here](https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core)), which includes the MPL token as a submodule (`maple-token` repo located [here](https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-token)).

All technical documentation for the protocol is located in the `maple-core` [wiki](https://github.com/maple-labs/maple-core/wiki).

The commit hashes to be used for this contest are 
- `maple-core`: `1b151c79ae1406b46405bb37cf82f033b1ba69dc` 
- `maple-token`: `834e8392e4534fc405d70c58f0f7679b111e6e83`

It should be noted that there will be code that is merged into the develop branch of `maple-core` during the course of the Code Arena audit, but it will not be related to updating any functionality. It will just be for adding/refactoring tests, creating an end-to-end launch simulation using HEVM, and potentially updating events.

Any technical questions that wardens have can be answered privately through Discord DMs. Discord contacts for the Maple smart contracts team are listed below:
